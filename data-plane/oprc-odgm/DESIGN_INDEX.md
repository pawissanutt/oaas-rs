## üìù Summary

The storage architecture redesign addresses critical performance bottlenecks in the OPRC ODGM system by:

1. **Separating Storage Concerns**: Different storage types for different access patterns
2. **Replication-Specific Architecture**: Only use complex storage for consensus algorithms that need it
3. **Zero-Copy Optimizations**: Leverage immutable storage engine files for massive performance gains
4. **Clean Design**: No backward compatibility constraints, allowing optimal architecture

The current recommended approach is the **Flexible Storage Design** enhanced with **Zero-Copy Snapshots** for maximum performance and minimal complexity.
