# OaaS Platform Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for the Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) platform built in Rust. The platform consists of multiple components organized into control plane services (Package Manager and Class Runtime Manager) and data plane services (ODGM), all sharing common modules for consistency and maintainability.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the OaaS platform in Rust, emphasizing shared modules, test-driven development, and production readiness. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery while maintaining high quality standards and proper architectural foundations.

The plan prioritizes building robust shared modules first, followed by the core services, and finally production-ready features. This approach ensures that all components are built on solid foundations and can evolve independently while maintaining consistency across the platform.
